## Hello World

ShreyaToken This Solidity program is an ERC-20 token contract named "ShreyaToken". It demonstrates the basic functionality of the ERC-20 token standard, including minting, transferring, and burning tokens. This program is designed for those who are new to Solidity and ERC-20 token development on the Ethereum blockchain.


## Description
The ShreyaToken contract is a smart contract written in Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain. It implements an ERC-20 token with the following features:

Minting Tokens: Upon deployment, 100 SHK tokens are minted to the contract's address. Token Transfer: The admin can transfer tokens from the contract's address to a recipient. Token Burning: Any user can burn their tokens, reducing the total supply. This contract demonstrates the use of OpenZeppelin's ERC-20 implementation, providing a secure and standard way to create tokens. It can serve as a foundation for more complex projects.


## Getting Started
Executing program
To run this program, you will need to use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Follow these steps to get started:

Visit Remix: Go to https://remix.ethereum.org/. Create a New File: Click on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar to create a new file. Save the File: Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., SrishtiToken.sol). Copy and Paste Code: Copy and paste the following code into the new file:





pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
contract SrishtiToken is ERC20 {
    address admin;

    constructor() ERC20("Shreya", "SHK") {
        admin = msg.sender;
        _mint(address(this), 100 * 10 ** decimals());
    }

    modifier onlyAdmin() {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "This does not belong to the Owner");
        _;
    }

    function createTokens(address recipient, uint256 quantity) public onlyAdmin {
        uint balance = balanceOf(address(this));
        require(balance >= quantity, "Not sufficient balance");
        _transfer(address(this), recipient, quantity);
    }

    function destroyTokens(uint256 amount) public {
        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function transferTokens(address recipient, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
        _transfer(msg.sender, recipient, amount);
        return true;
    }
}




To run the program, follow these steps:

Compile the Code:

Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Ensure the "Compiler" option is set to a compatible version, such as "0.8.0". Click on the "Compile ShreyaToken.sol" button. Deploy the Contract:

Click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "ShreyaToken" contract from the dropdown menu. Click on the "Deploy" button. Interact with the Contract:

Minting Tokens: Upon deployment, 100 SHK tokens are minted to the contract address. Creating Tokens: Call the createTokens function with the recipient address and quantity to transfer tokens from the contract address to the recipient. This can only be done by the admin. Destroying Tokens: Call the destroyTokens function with the amount to burn tokens from the caller's address.
